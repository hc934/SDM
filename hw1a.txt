I encounter a problem when I tried to clone the repository directly, so I use another command 'git remote add origin'. Anyway, I have some experience using git; however, I usually use those simple commands only. I have never developed a project with large scale, so I do not really have chances do deal with tasks like develop branches. Therefore, I may encounter some difficulties when learning git branching techniques.
